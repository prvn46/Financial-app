# Financial-app
* I have tried to make the user experience as simple as possible so that anybody can use with ease meanwhile as accurate as possible.

* To keep the application clean i have only used HTML, CSS and Javascript and have not used frameworks.

* As it is extremely difficult to implement and update tables without using any frameworks, I have did my best to keep the content organized and having it displayed in a table layout.

* As I did not have much knowledge on the calculations initially, I spent some time to do small research and clarify with my friends to get the basic knowledge. So any minute error (if any) are to be considered.

* Also I have managed my best to keep the application from failing or breaking down in case of faulty inputs or user made mistakes.

* I have spent some time with a good amount of commitment to implement this application, so looking forward for a positive reply. Thankyou:)
